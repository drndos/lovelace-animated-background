# Animated Lovelace Background

This module is for [Lovelace](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace) on [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

Create animated backgrounds based on the state of one of your entities. Originally designed for changing with the weather, Ã  la [VideoBackground-Card](https://github.com/Perdemot/Lovelace-Cards/tree/master/VideoBackground-Card), you can now choose any entity in home assistant and create an animated background for each of its states.

A big thanks to [CCH](https://github.com/maykar/compact-custom-header) and [VideoBackground-Card](https://github.com/Perdemot/Lovelace-Cards/tree/master/VideoBackground-Card) for the inspiration. All example animation files used in this repo are originally from the VideoBackground-Card repo.

## Installation Method 1: Manual

### Step 1

Install `animated-background` by copying `animated-background.js` from this repo to `<config directory>/www/animated-background.js` on your Home Assistant instance. This repo also includes a handful of default animation pages to use if you would like.

### Step 2

Add the custom element in the root of your `ui-lovelace.yaml`, not in a view or card.
Ex:
```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/animated-background.js
    type: module
animated_background:
  default_url: /local/animated-background/background-animations/clear-day.html
  included_users:
    - Villhellm
  sun: sun.sun
  entity: "weather.dark_sky"
  state_url:
      'clear-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/clear-day.html
      'clear-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/clear-night.html
      'cloudy-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/cloudy-day.html
      'cloudy-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/cloudy-night.html
      'fog-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/fog-day.html
      'partly-cloudy-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/partly-cloudy-day.html
      'partly-cloudy-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/partly-cloudy-night.html
      'rain-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/rain-day.html
      'rain-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/rain-day.html
      'snow-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/snow-day.html
      'snow-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/snow-night.html
      'wind-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/wind-day.html
      'wind-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/wind-night.html
```

## Installation Method 2: HACS

### Step 1

Make sure you have [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) installed, and proceed with the instructions for [adding a custom repository](https://custom-components.github.io/hacs/usage/settings/#add-custom-repositories)

### Step 2

Add the custom element in the root of your `ui-lovelace.yaml`, not in a view or card.
Ex:
```yaml
resources:
  - url: /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/animated-background.js
    type: module
animated_background:
  default_url: /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/clear-day.html
  included_users:
    - Villhellm
  sun: sun.sun
  entity: "weather.dark_sky"
  state_url:
      'clear-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/clear-day.html
      'clear-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/clear-night.html
      'cloudy-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/cloudy-day.html
      'cloudy-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/cloudy-night.html
      'fog-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/fog-day.html
      'partly-cloudy-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/partly-cloudy-day.html
      'partly-cloudy-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/partly-cloudy-night.html
      'rain-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/rain-day.html
      'rain-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/rain-day.html
      'snow-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/snow-day.html
      'snow-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/snow-night.html
      'wind-day': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/wind-day.html
      'wind-night': /community_plugin/lovelace-animated-background/background-animations/wind-night.html
```

# Configuration

Configuration for Animated Background goes into the root of your Lovelace config.

## Options

| Name | Type | Requirement | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| default_url | string | **Optional** | If no matching state is found, this is the fallback url
| entity | string | **Optional** | Entity to check for state changes
| state_url | map | **Optional** | Map of states and urls. Required if `entity` is defined
| included_users | list | **Optional** | List of users that will display animated background. If this option is set any users not included in this list will be excluded.
| included_devices | list | **Optional** | List of devices that will display animated background. If this option is set any devices not included in this list will be excluded.
| excluded_users | list | **Optional** | Users to be excluded
| excluded_devices | list | **Optional** | Devices to be excluded
| sun | string | **Optional** | Entity to check for sun position

While all entries are optional, it is recommended to at least set `default_url` or `entity` with `state_url`. Without one of those set you would never know this plugin was installed.
